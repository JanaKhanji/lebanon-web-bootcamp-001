Add a universal navbar (it appears on every page) to the home page that includes
buttons that go to the following pages:

- Home button, takes you to the home page.
- Search box where you can type the movie or actor name and display the
  related results. Logic will be added later, just add a dummy search bar. **It should be a component.**

### Main Component

Add an empty main section below the navbar and above the footer. It can be empty for now.

### Footer Component

Add a universal footer that includes:

- Credit to you and your partner for building the website,
- You and your partner's github link inside an icon and optionally, your social
  media links.

### Styling

- Optionally: you can use react-bootstrap library. Search on how to install it and get started using it

# Homework

- Add simple functionality to the search box. Whenever you type something, the text inside the input should be logged to the console.
- The same should happen when you hit enter
